// Package workqueue provides a simple queue that supports the following
// features:
//   - Fair: items processed in the order in which they are added.
//   - Stingy: a single item will not be processed multiple times concurrently,
//     and if an item is added multiple times before it can be processed, it
//     will only be processed once.
//   - Multiple consumers and producers. In particular, it is allowed for an
//     item to be reenqueued while it is being processed.
//   - Shutdown notifications.
package workqueue // import "k8s.io/client-go/util/workqueue"
